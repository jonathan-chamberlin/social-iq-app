# Social IQ — iOS App

## Stack
- SwiftUI (iOS 17+), Swift 5.0+
- @Observable ONLY (never ObservableObject, never @Published)
- Supabase (auth + DB) — see .claude/skills/supabase-schema-rls/
- Superwall (paywalls) — see .claude/skills/superwall-campaigns/
- Mixpanel (analytics) — see .claude/skills/mixpanel-taxonomy/
- NavigationStack (never NavigationView)

## Architecture
- Pattern: MVVM with @Observable ViewModels (one per feature)
- Views: Max 100 lines. Extract subviews aggressively.
- Services: Protocol-based. Inject via init, never hardcode.
- Navigation: Type-safe Route enums, not string-based.
- Supabase: All database calls go through the service layer, never directly from ViewModels.

## Coding Conventions

### File organization
- One type per file, named after the type. Private helper structs in the same file are acceptable.
- Files MUST stay under 400 lines. If a view exceeds this, split into coordinator + subcomponents.
- `// MARK: -` section headers in every file with 3+ sections.
- Views organized by feature folder (Home/, Lesson/, Onboarding/), not by type.

### Naming
- Swift types: PascalCase. Supabase columns: snake_case.
- Analytics event names: snake_case (`onboarding_step_completed`).
- Onboarding step files: `Onboarding<StepName>Step.swift`.
- Enums for fixed option sets (OnboardingStep, QuizSubStep, AnalyticsEvent).

### State management
- Views own `@State` for UI state. No separate ViewModel unless the view has async data loading.
- Multi-step flows use an enum-based step system (see `OnboardingStep`). NEVER use integer step tracking.
- To add/remove a step: add/remove one enum case + one step view file. Navigation, analytics, and progress dots adapt automatically.
- Bindings (`@Binding`) for child views that mutate parent state. Closures for actions (onSelect, onComplete).

### Services
- Services are structs (not classes) accessed via `SupabaseService.shared` or instantiated directly.
- Service functions that take user input MUST use a data struct (e.g., `OnboardingData`) instead of 5+ parameters.
- All analytics tracking goes through `AnalyticsService.track(event:properties:)`.
- NEVER call `Mixpanel.mainInstance().flush()` per-event. Mixpanel batches automatically.

### Error handling
- Custom error enums conforming to `LocalizedError` per service.
- Best-effort saves (onboarding, lesson progress) — catch and continue, never block the user.

### Constants and magic values
- Magic strings shared across files MUST be extracted to `AppConfig` or a constants enum.
- UserDefaults keys MUST be in `AppConfig` (e.g., `AppConfig.shouldAutoOpenLesson1Key`).
- Animation timing values MUST be in a private `enum Timing` at the top of the struct, not inline.
- URLs and entry field IDs MUST be `private static let` constants, not inline string literals.

### Shared UI patterns
- Card backgrounds: use `.cardBackground()` (defined in Theme.swift), never inline `RoundedRectangle.fill(Color.white.opacity(0.08))`.
- Gold gradient: use `Theme.goldGradient`, never inline `LinearGradient(colors: [Theme.gold, Theme.goldLight], ...)`.
- Semantic opacity: use `Theme.Opacity.disabled/.secondary/.muted/.subtle`, never inline magic opacity values (0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7).
- Screen background: use `.screenBackground()`, never inline `Color.black.ignoresSafeArea()`.
- Haptics: use `HapticService.light()/.medium()/.heavy()/.success()`, never inline `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`.
- Sentence-splitting: use `.sentenceFormatted` (String extension), never inline `.replacingOccurrences(of: ". ", with: ".\n")`.

### Onboarding-specific
- `OnboardingView.swift` is the coordinator only — state, navigation, analytics. No step UI.
- Each step's UI lives in its own file and receives only the bindings/callbacks it needs.
- Reusable patterns: `OnboardingOptionListStep` for any single-select auto-advance list.
- Scare bullet content lives as static data on `OnboardingScareStep`, not in the coordinator.

## Banned APIs (AI agents hallucinate these — use the modern replacement)
- `foregroundColor()` → `foregroundStyle()`
- `cornerRadius()` → `clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius:))`
- `GeometryReader` (for simple sizing) → `containerRelativeFrame()`
- `onChange(of:perform:)` → `onChange(of:) { oldValue, newValue in }`
- `onAppear` with async work → `.task { }`
- `Timer.publish` / Combine → `AsyncStream` or `.task` with `sleep`
- `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` → `Task { try? await Task.sleep(for:) }` (no GCD in this project)

## Skill Routing
- SwiftUI views/components → swiftui-patterns, swiftui-components
- Product decisions → app-mafia-mobile
- Supabase schema/RLS → supabase-schema-rls
- TestFlight deploy → testflight-deploy
- Analytics/Mixpanel → mixpanel-taxonomy
- Paywalls/Superwall → superwall-campaigns
- App Store Connect → app-store-connect

## TestFlight Awareness
- Local changes are NOT on TestFlight until archived and uploaded — say this explicitly
- After code changes, proactively offer to archive and upload if goal is device testing
- Track temporary debug changes and revert before committing

## Rules
- After changes: build → verify compilation → run tests → screenshot
- **UI changes MUST be visually verified via XcodeBuildMCP before reporting SUCCESS / Done.** Build-passing is not sufficient proof for any change that affects pixels. Workflow: `session_show_defaults` → `boot_sim` → install the freshly built `.app` → `launch_app_sim` → navigate to the affected screen (use `snapshot_ui` if `tap` by label fails) → `screenshot` → `Read` the screenshot → confirm the change is visible → only then report SUCCESS. If you report `PARTIAL` because you skipped this, you skipped it wrong — do it before reporting. Never wait for the user to ask "did you screenshot?".

## Product Strategy Reference
Always read `~/.claude/skills/app-mafia-mobile/SKILL.md` for the App Mafia playbook.

Project-specific docs live in `references/` at the repo root:
- `ideation-reference.md` — problem definition, target audience, app concept
- `design-reference.md` — UX/UI decisions, onboarding flow, screen designs
- `competitive-analysis.md` — competitor landscape
- `tech-stack-reference.md` — tech stack and rationale
- `monetization-reference.md` — pricing, revenue levers, paywall strategy
- `analytics-event-taxonomy.md` — Mixpanel events, user properties, key funnels
- `founder-advice-foundation-hacks.md` — validated founder feedback on ICP, retention, product direction

## Gotchas (append new mistakes here)
- Xcode project has a space in it: "Social IQ.xcodeproj" — always quote paths
- Do NOT use Combine (Timer.publish, etc.) — the project uses async/await exclusively
- Force unwraps on URL construction will be rejected — use optional binding or guard/let
- `import UIKit` should only appear in Utilities (HapticService, SoundPlayer) — views use the service wrappers
- Do NOT use `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` — use `Task { try? await Task.sleep(for:) }` instead
- Do NOT import framework SDKs (SuperwallKit, Supabase) directly in Views — use service wrappers (SuperwallService, SupabaseService)
- All `print()` statements MUST be wrapped in `#if DEBUG` / `#endif` — no debug logging in release builds
- Supabase `.auth.session` reads from local Keychain cache WITHOUT server validation — use `refreshSession()` for session restore to catch deleted/invalidated users
- Apple Sign In only sends `fullName`/`email` on the VERY FIRST authorization per app+Apple ID pair — persist these to `user_profiles` immediately, never rely on `auth.users` metadata (gets overwritten on re-auth)
- NEVER use `Superwall.shared.getPresentationResult()` as a pre-check before `register()` — it consumes campaign evaluations (counts as "matched") without assigning variants, making paywalls silently fail
- Simulator vs TestFlight differ in 3 critical ways: (1) StoreKit has no real transactions on sim, (2) iOS Keychain survives app deletion on device, (3) `#if DEBUG` code is stripped from TestFlight builds — always diagnose with MCP/dashboard BEFORE deploying code changes
- When debugging "paywall not showing", check Superwall subscription status and dashboard config FIRST, before modifying code — 4 sessions were wasted changing code when the root cause was stale StoreKit state
- `SuperwallService.identify(userId:)` MUST be called after sign-in — without it, Superwall uses device identity and new accounts inherit stale subscription state from previous users
- Network calls on the launch/auth path (Supabase `refreshSession`, profile fetches) MUST be wrapped in `withTimeout` (5s) with a cached-state fallback — without it, the loading screen hangs indefinitely on weak/no networks (e.g. frat basement Wi-Fi). Cache booleans like `onboarding_completed` to UserDefaults so the app can boot offline.
- After sign-out, reset any session-scoped `@State` flags in `Social_IQApp` (e.g. `onboardingChecked`) via an `onChange(of: userId)` observer — otherwise re-auth (especially after delete-account) inherits the previous session's check state and skips required flows.
- `.ignoresSafeArea()` placed on a child of a `GeometryReader` (or inside a `.mask {}` chain) extends the masked content's coordinate space by the safe-area inset, throwing off any `.position(x:y:)` math by ~62pt at the top. For overlays/spotlights/coachmarks: apply `.ignoresSafeArea()` to the OUTER `GeometryReader` only, so its proxy reports the full screen frame and global→local conversions produce zero offset.
- For position-sensitive UI (overlays, spotlights, coachmarks, popovers, anchored tooltips), screenshot eyeballing is INSUFFICIENT verification — dim opacity / similar colors hide offset bugs. Workflow: write the computed coordinates to UserDefaults via `UserDefaults.standard.set("anchor=\(rect) overlay=\(rect) local=\(rect)", forKey: "debug_X")`, then read with `xcrun simctl get_app_container <UDID> com.jonathanchamberlin.Social-IQ data` + `/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Print :debug_X" "<dataDir>/Library/Preferences/com.jonathanchamberlin.Social-IQ.plist"`. Verify the numbers match the `snapshot_ui` AXFrame of the target before claiming SUCCESS.
- `print()` does NOT appear in `start_sim_log_cap` output — that capture filters by app subsystem / OSLog only. Use the UserDefaults + PlistBuddy round-trip above, or migrate to `os.Logger(subsystem: "com.jonathanchamberlin.Social-IQ", ...)` if you need streaming logs.
- Sign in with Apple already provides the user's name on first authorization — NEVER add a "First name" / required name TextField AFTER the Apple Sign In step. Apple App Review rejects this under guideline 4.0 as a duplicate flow. Keep the silent pipeline (`appleFirstName` → `viewModel.userName` → Supabase) for personalization, but never ask the user to re-enter the name post-auth.
- iOS Simulator runtime build mismatch silently breaks `xcodebuild` — `xcrun simctl runtime list` reports "Ready" while `xcodebuild -showdestinations` lists zero simulator destinations and prints "iOS X.Y is not installed". Diagnose with `xcrun simctl runtime match list` (compare `Chosen Runtime: <build>` vs the installed runtime build, e.g. Xcode 26.4.1 wants `23E252` but the installed 26.4 sim is `23E244`). Fix: install the matching runtime via Xcode → Settings → Platforms.
- Superwall "Test Mode Active" overlay with `Bundle ID mismatch: expected X, got X` where both strings LOOK identical is almost always **trailing whitespace in the Superwall dashboard's registered bundle_id**. The dashboard UI renders the value trimmed visually but stores it raw; Superwall's SDK does strict string equality (no trim), so ~85 invisible trailing spaces were enough to flip production into Test Mode. Never trust the popup's rendered `expected`/`got` strings — they are both rendered trimmed. Diagnose via `mcp__superwall__list_projects` and inspect `applications[].bundle_id` with `repr()` and `len()`; compare to `Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier` length. Fix: in the Superwall dashboard, focus the bundle_id field → Cmd+A → Delete → retype from scratch (do not paste). Re-save. Never compare the two strings visually.
- This project uses Xcode 16's `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup` — new `.swift` files dropped under `Social IQ/` are auto-included in the target with ZERO pbxproj edits. The old "NEVER modify .pbxproj directly" rule is a no-op here for file additions; just Write the file and build.
- Lesson-step `correctIndex` mismatches silently break forward progress: `LessonView` only renders the "Explain" / advance button when `isCorrectSelection` is true, so an off-by-one typo traps the user on the step with no visible error. Build passes. Always cross-check `correctIndex` against the `options` array index (0-based; option C = index 2) before claiming a new lesson works — visual test every new lesson through the SPEAK step.
- `xcrun agvtool new-marketing-version` does NOT update `MARKETING_VERSION` in this project's pbxproj (Xcode 16 file-system-synchronized format) even though it exits 0 and prints success. You must edit `MARKETING_VERSION` directly in both the Debug AND Release `XCBuildConfiguration` sections of `Social IQ.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`. `agvtool next-version -all` (build number) DOES work — it's the inverse of what the tool name implies.
